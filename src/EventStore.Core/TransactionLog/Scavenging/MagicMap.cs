	// up in the log.

		//qq the API here can either expose a way for the accumulator to get and set the stream data
		// OR it can provide a way to just be told there is new metadata or tombstones and it can
		// update itself. for now run with the former because
		//    1. accumulator can drive, map can just be a datastructure
		//    2. map probably has to provide an api to read _anyway_
		// call this to record what the current metadata is for a stream.
		// if there is previous metadata this will just overwrite it.
		//
		// this needs to spot if there is a hash collision. can it do it? bear in mind that it can be
		// called multiple times for the same stream.
		// 1. hash the stream name, see if we already have a record for that stream.
		//         (check the (hash -> name) cache first) (check the collisions first also?)
		//    - if we do have a record for the hash
		//        - if that record has the same stream name
		//            - means we need to store the address of the metadata record to get the name
		//            - (make sure we dont scavenge that record while referencing it.. or if we legit can,
		//               that something sensible happens)
		//            - just update it. no collision.
		//            - (note we can cache the (hash -> stream name) lookup, populate it as we call Set as well)
		//        - else (different stream name)
		//            - collision detected!
		//            - store the streamName and streamData in another datastructure (collision structure)
		//            - do we need to pull the one that got collided with out into the collision structure?
		//                - we can if we need to because we have both stream names and stream datas here.
		//                  that will do for now.
